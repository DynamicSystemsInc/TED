# Trusted Extensions Desktop 

## Overview 

The release of Oracle Solaris 11.4 removed the trusted desktop capability, previously present in Solaris up to version 11.3. Dynamic Systems' Trusted Extensions Desktop (TED) restores the Trusted Desktop functionality to Solaris 11.4.

TED consists of a set of about 50 packages that are delivered in an IPS repository whose publisher name is trusted-desktop. About half of the packages provide new functionality such as the MATE Desktop components. The remaining packages are replacements for Solaris packages.
