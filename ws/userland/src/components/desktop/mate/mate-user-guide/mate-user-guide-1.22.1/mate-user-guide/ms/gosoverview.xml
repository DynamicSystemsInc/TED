  <para xml:lang="en">The desktop lies behind all other components on your screen. When no windows are visible, the desktop is that part of the screen between the top and bottom panels. You can place files and folders on the desktop that you want to have easy access to.</para>
  <para xml:lang="en">The desktop also has several special objects on it:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><para xml:lang="en">The <interface xml:lang="en">Computer</interface> icon gives you access to CDs, removable media such as floppy disks, and also the entire filesystem (also known as the root filesystem).

  <para xml:lang="en">A <firstterm>window</firstterm> is a rectangular area of the screen, usually with a border all around and a title bar at the top. You can think of a window as a screen within the screen. Each window displays an application, allowing you to have more than one application visible, and work on more than one task at a time. You can also think of windows as pieces of paper on your desktop: they can overlap, or be side by side, for example.</para>
  
  <para xml:lang="en">You can control a window's position of the screen, as well as its size. You can control which windows overlap other windows, so the one you want to work with is completely visible. For more about moving and resizing windows, see <xref linkend="windows-manipulating"/>.</para>
  
  <para xml:lang="en">Each window is not necessarily a different application. An application usually has one main window, and may open additional windows at the request of the user.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">The applications that are provided with the MATE Desktop
  share many common features, such as similar open and save dialogs and similar-looking icons. This is because they have all been developed using the MATE development platform. An application developed using this platform is called a <firstterm>MATE-compliant application</firstterm>. For example, <application>Caja</application> and the <application>pluma</application> text editor are MATE-compliant applications.</para>
      <para xml:lang="en">Some features of MATE-compliant applications are as follows:</para>
      <itemizedlist>

          <para xml:lang="en">Menubars, toolbars, and statusbars</para>
          <para xml:lang="en">Most MATE-compliant applications have a menubar, a toolbar, and a statusbar.
  The menubars usually have a similar structure; for example, the <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu always
  contains an <guimenuitem>About</guimenuitem> menu item.</para>
          <para xml:lang="en">A <firstterm>toolbar</firstterm> is a bar that appears under the menubar.
  A toolbar contains buttons for the most commonly-used commands. A <firstterm>statusbar</firstterm> is a bar at the bottom of a window that provides information about the current state of what you are viewing in the window. Applications might also contains other bars. For example, <application>Caja</application> contains a location bar.</para>

  from a <application>Caja</application> window to a web browser, the file
  is displayed in HTML format in the browser. However, when you drag the HTML
