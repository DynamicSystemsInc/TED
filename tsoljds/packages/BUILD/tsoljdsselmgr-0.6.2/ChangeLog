2006-01-30 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* src/selmgr*.c: mostly completed port.
	Still needs the View as functionality (currently always views as text)
	I still have no idea why people want to view selections as hex but 
	whatever. Also need to make the view conditional.  i.e. dont show if the
	transaction is not authorised.

	NOTE: to get GTK text view C&P working correctly (no dup confirmation
	dialogs and proper text display) you need to add the following line to
	the end of the file "/usr/dt/config/sel_config"

	replytype: GTK_TEXT_BUFFER_CONTENTS
