# This file controls the action of the selection
# manager and the file manager drag and drop confirmers.
# There is an entry for the possible types of upgrade/downgrade
# transfers based upon the source label and destination label.
# (Note that the equalsl entry is used by file manager but is
# ignored by selection manager, which always auto-confirms 
# equal SL transfers.)
#
# The file has two sections, the auto confirm section and
# and the auto reply section.
#
#
# Auto Confirm/Cancel Section
#
#   Specifies for each transfer type whether the action should
#   be automatically or manually confirmed.
#
# Auto confirm?     y -> confirm transfer without displaying confirmer
#                        (note: user must still have proper authorizations)
#                   n -> display confirmer before processing transfer
#
# Auto cancel?     y -> cancel transfer without displaying confirmer
#                        (note: user must still have proper authorizations)
#                   n -> display confirmer before processing transfer
#
# Auto confirmation will take precedence over auto canceling
