	  and returning authenticated passwords. Remembering authenticated
	  passwords has security risks (even though TCDE does it)

2006-04-13 Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* src/constraint-scaling.c src/label_builder.c src/pam_conv.c
	  src/pam_dialog.c src/sel_config.c src/test.c src/userattr.c:
	  passed C files trough indent. Indent parameters used:

	* src/pam_dialog.[ch] src/pam_conv.[ch]: make password dialog
	  system modality optional via a g_object property (settable in
	  constructor only). Message dialogs need to be optionally
	  system modal also.
	* added src/message_dialog.[ch]: Introducing GnomeTsolMessageDialog,
	  the hideous child of GtkMessageDialog that has no additional 
	  functionality except to support system modality.

2006-03-20 Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* src/pam_conv.c: pop dialogs up on the correct screen.

2006-03-10 Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* src/pam_dialog.c: check for unsuccessful pointer and keyboard
	  grabs. If unsuccessful sleep momentarily and regrab until both
	  keyboard and pointer grabs are obtained. Fixes pain in the ass
	  bug that prevented keyboard and mouse input when the dialog was
	  made system modal.

2006-02-21 Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* src/pam_conv.c: switched to using GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR 
	  style message dialogs for PAM_ERROR_MSG style messages
	  now that info messages are no longer reported as errors
	  by pam_store.so

2006-02-03 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* src/tsol-pics.h: changed stripe back to low res.  It looks 
	better in a dialog
	* src/constraint-scaling.c: added drop shadow to text in 
	coloured label

2006-02-03 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* src/tsol-pics.h: made stripe image dump higher res and added shield
	and role hat image dumps.  Sounds more complication and like I did 
	something more than copy this file from the stripe doesn't it

2006-02-03 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* src/tsol-pics.h: stripe rendering image dump

	* src/pam_conv.h: add 2 new variables 2 the pam conversation
	  app data structure to allow something more informative than
	  just the pam suppled prompt in the dialog.
	* src/pam_conv.c: check for client supplied information messages
	  when handling PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_[ON|OFF] and display in dialog.

2006-01-31 Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* AUTHORS: add myself - oh the glory!
	* libgnometsol.pc.in: add -lpam to the linker flags.
	* src/pam_conv.c: use stock gtk message dialogs for
	  PAM_TEXT_INFO and PAM_ERROR_MSG type messages. I've
	  left the old implementation commented out for the time
	  being in case I decide to revert. Otherwise I'll remove
	  it.

2006-01-31 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* src/sel_config.c: changed the location of the settings file

2006-01-30 Erwann Chenede - <erwann.chenede@sun.com>

2006-01-26 Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* configure.in: Drop dependency on libXtsol and just check for
	  the presence of the PAM libs. Pretty sure they'll always be
	  there :-/

2006-01-25 Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* src/pam_conv.[ch]: implements general purpose pam conversation
	  function for use by trusted stripe and change password agent.
	* src/pam_dialog.c: disable system modal behaviour of dialog for
	  now as it is causing weird pointer grab related problems when
	  invoked from the trusted stripe.
	* src/Makefile.am: add pam_conv.c and pam_conv.h

2006-01-20 Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* src/pam_dialog.[ch]: implement GnomeTsolPasswordDialog g_object.
	  Still need to provide a pam conversation function to go with it
	  once I've ironed out some of the UI quirks.
	* src/Makefile.am: add pam_dialog.c and pam_dialog.h
	* configure.in: add libgnomeui-2.0 to pkg-config checks

	* Makefile.am: added test program as a noinst
	* configure.in: remove libgnomeui from libs.  dont need it
	* src/test.c: small test driver for gnome_label_builder
	* src/label_builder.h: API change, should be more friendly
	* src//label_builder.c: new API, new entry completion for typing
	labels, fixed autoselect of mandatory compartments, memory fix ups

	  to work around mysterious memory corruption bug that causes the
	  workspace switcher applet to segv.

2005-09-30 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* autogen.sh: new autogen to fix aclocal issues with gnome-common
	* mkinstalldirs: updated (still need to get rid of this when building
	  with a newer version of glib)

2005-09-02 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* src/label_builder.c: get rid of nasty frames

2005-09-01 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: dist bz2 instead of gz

2005-09-01 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	in the future
