This package consists of a library with four main uses:

1) The Trusted GNOME label builder GUI
The gnome_label_builder object is a GTK_DIALOG that implements a label
contruction/selection UI for use when logging in and changing the label of
workspaces etc.  The range of labels a user can select from is bounded by
the label range of the workstation that are using AND the label range assigned
to the user in their user_attr entry.

2) Selection manager configuration utilities
The utility functions here are used to load the selection manager configuration
and compare labels of source and destination of selection transactions to 
indicate what type of transaction is occuring. For example upgrading/downgrading
the sensitivity label of data.  These functions are used by the selection
manager UI application that intercepts cut and paste / drag and drop operations
and the file manager when files have been dragged and dropped from one label to
another.

3) /etc/user_attr convenience functions
There is a single entry point here to get a value from /etc/user_attr or 
kva_match() for any valid user_attr key.

4) PAM conversation functions for role authentication and password changing.
