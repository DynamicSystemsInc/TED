# Automounter executable script.

# to have any effect. Furthermore it must have the sticky bit set.

# This script receives as $1 the name of the object (file or directory)
# that is being accessed under the moint point. For example if the
# moint point is /home and someone is accessing /home/johndoe then
# $1 will be "johndoe".
# The script is expected to write the path of the physical location
# on stdout.

# in the first column in the file /etc/auto_master.

# Where the physical user home directories are

# The group owner to give to a user's home directory

# Sanity check

if [[ $hdir != $HOMEDIRPATH/* ]]; then
# Someone is trying to access a directory under $HOMEDIRPATH
# which is not the name of a user. This we simply ignore, i.e. we exit
# without writing anything on stdout. This will make the automounter
# ignore the action and thus the user will get an error.

# Now we know that $1 is a valid user with a home directory
# under $HOMEDIRPATH

# Next see if the user's physical home dir exist. If not create it.

if [ -d "$phdir" ]; then
# Yes the user's physical home dir already exist.
# Return the path of the physical home dir to the automounter
# and exit.
echo "localhost:$phdir"
exit
fi

# Create the directory
#mkdir -p $phdir
zfs create rpool/$phdir

# Set owner and group
chown "$1":"$HOMEDIRGROUP" $phdir

# At this point we can copy setup files into the user's home directory
# e.g. files from /etc/skel. This step is optional.

# Example for Bash logins :
cp /etc/skel/local.profile $phdir/.profile
chown "$1":"$HOMEDIRGROUP" $phdir/.profile

# This was all we needed to do.
# Return the path of the physical home dir to the automounter
# and exit.
