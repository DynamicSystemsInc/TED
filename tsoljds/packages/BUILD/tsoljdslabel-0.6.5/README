This package contains the tsoljdslabel login label selection GUI.

It serves two purposes:

1) Shows the user loging in some relevant data about their current session.
This includes the system's Message of the Day (/etc/motd) the roles available to
the user, the min and max labels the user is allowed to operate at, date and
time of when the user last logged in and from where.
From this dialog the user can elect to restrict his/her session to a single 
label or continue with a multi label session.

2) Shows a label selection dialog (gnome_tsol_label_builder from libgnometsol).
This allows the user to select a sensitivity label for a single label session
OR the higest clearance they wish to operate at for a multi label session.
(See libgnometsol for more info on gnome_tsol_label_builder)
